# GameplayTest

- The time to perform the exercise
The first step was download the game Fun Race 3D and play some levels to understand the mechanics.
Then I created a new project in Unity and configured the project to the platform Android, change the Project Settings -> Player configurations and adjust the screen size to Portrait.
After that, I implemented the player movement and the main scenario with the goal. I use the first hour with these steps.
The second hour was to do the state game machine and search for information about preset path movement for the player. But I decided to move to the next step before implement a automatic path player movement.
I implemented the two different obstacles, first the vertical ones and then the horizontal. This took me 1 hour and a half.
The next half hour was to comment the code and do the last modifications.
The last hour was to prepare the commit in GIT and write this document.


-Difficult parts and what could be better
I have searched information about how to do a path movement for the player because in this level the player can only walk in the Z axis.
I didn't have any assets to implement in the game so I wanted to make one functional easy level instead of the automatic path for the player.
The interface and the materials of the objects can be improved but these actually are also functional to show the code.
I didn't have time to implement a player with idle, run, win, lose, etc, animations.

-Step further
I didn't implement the multiplayer option that the example game has, so with more time I could do this option.
Also I can model basic platforms and obstacles in Maya or Blender to not use the basic forms the Unity editor has.

-Opinion
I am happy with the result of the exercise because the level is complete with the different states of the game. You can complete the level, lose, and restart the game.
